i had so much to learn from Ahmad sir during this last 2-3 months
I am really happy to drop my final project.

## Introduction
 Hey Team Verzeo, very happy to upload my Project on Weather Forecast Web App. 
 I have taken the help of Markup language HTML, used CSS and JavaScript, jQuery, and the OpenWeather API for scripting the entire thing

## About The Project

This is Weather Forecast App using JavaScript. This Application shows you the weather forecast of the next 5-days of any place in the world

you will have to type the name of the city of which you want the weather for, then click on the search option inorder to get the forecast

my application shows a lot of character, it mentions the current Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and UV Index with images of the weather
